# Summary:


This repository contains a website which may be used to book badminton courts in your area. It is a website which is used to gauge the availability of courts depending on demand in a particular area and for a user to look for more courts in their particular area depending on availability and price of the particular court for a specified period of time. It has been a collaborative effort by a team of three people who have collectively worked on the project using the MERN stack for web development.

The website has been developed using React for the front end and Node, Express and MongoDB for the back end. 

It has been divided into two folders, front-end and Back-end which contain the front end and back end respectively.

The src folder in front=end contains the main React files obviously written in JavaScript for app.js and index.js and some additional styling using a CSS file and one index.html file which will be run when we execute the entire code through npm.

Within /src, I have created another folder called components which has essentially the entire web page. Each part of the web page called a component has been
put into the components folder. This includes the Navbar, the footer, the home page, about page, sign in page, sign up page etc. There is also another folder within src called Routes which has one file called in the main app.js and links all the different pages with ease.

The back end basically contains the back end for the booking, login, sign up and profile pages.

For the purposes of accessibility and ease of editing, I have separated each component into a different folder so for any outsider accessing it, he/she may 
be able to view the files with ease and will not have any trouble figuring out where to commit what changes in case they would like to contribute to the 
project.

This is my first project on React and I would like to continuously improve and learn more so anybody looking to work on any projects can feel free to contact me.

Best,

Raghav
